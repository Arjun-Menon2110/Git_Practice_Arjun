Git is a powerful version control system widely used in software development and collaborative projects. It is useful because: 
1. Version Control: Git tracks changes made to files, allowing you to access, compare, and restore previous versions of your code or documents. 
2. Collaboration: It enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, merging changes efficiently and resolving conflicts. 
3. Branching and Merging: Git allows the creation of branches to develop features or experiment independently. Changes can be merged back into the main project without affecting others. 
4. Distributed System: Each contributor has a full copy of the repository, ensuring data redundancy and offline work capabilities. 
5. Open Source and Free: Git is free and open-source, making it accessible to developers and organizations of all sizes. 
6. Integration and Tools: It integrates with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, facilitating code sharing, reviews, and deployment. 
By using Git, teams can enhance productivity, maintain code quality, and ensure seamless project management. 
7)Use git branch to create branches, git checkout to switch branches, and git merge to integrate changes.
